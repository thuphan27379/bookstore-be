Beyond basic
The basic
The purpose of this guide is to help learners set up an express project quick while also introduce the 4 basic operation of a CRUD flow.
It is in our intention that learners could identify repeated code pattern to get themself familiar to a basic express project flow.
Beyond the basics
Learner are not expected but encouraged to try find way to apply D-R-Y in this project. Some areas to look into are :
A utility function that allow sending consistent responses
A utility function that allow throwing consistent exceptions/errors
Split the code by organize route callback functions in controllers/
Split the code and research on express-validator to handle input validator
Re-thinking the business logic of each controller. Would it cover all the user behavior? What could go wrong? Should a request cause certain impacts?
Update http status code.
Consult your mentor with these questions in mind for a better understanding of the concept
